## Introduction

The `wanikani` package provides a complete R interface to the WaniKani API v2. WaniKani is a Japanese learning platform that uses spaced repetition to teach kanji and vocabulary.

This vignette will walk you through the basics of using the package.

## Installation

```{r installation}
# Install from GitHub
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("yourusername/wanikani.r")
```

## Authentication

First, you need to get your API token from WaniKani:
https://www.wanikani.com/settings/personal_access_tokens

Set it as an environment variable (recommended):

```{r auth}
Sys.setenv(WANIKANI_API_TOKEN = "your_token_here")
```

Or add it to your `.Renviron` file for persistence across R sessions.

## Basic Usage

### Load the package

```{r setup}
library(wanikani)
```

### Get User Information

```{r user}
# Get your user profile
user <- wk_user()

# Access user data
username <- user$data$username
current_level <- user$data$level
subscription_type <- user$data$subscription$type

cat(sprintf("User: %s\nLevel: %d\n", username, current_level))
```

### Get Study Summary

```{r summary}
# Get summary of upcoming lessons and reviews
summary <- wk_summary()

# When is your next review?
next_review <- summary$data$next_reviews_at
print(next_review)

# How many reviews are available now?
available_reviews <- length(summary$data$reviews)
print(available_reviews)
```

## Working with Subjects

Subjects are the radicals, kanji, and vocabulary that you learn in WaniKani.

### Get Subjects by Level

```{r subjects-level}
# Get all subjects from level 1
level1 <- wk_subjects(levels = 1)

# How many items in level 1?
num_items <- length(level1$data)
print(num_items)

# Get the first item
first_item <- level1$data[[1]]
print(first_item$data$characters)
print(first_item$data$meanings)
```

### Filter by Type

```{r subjects-type}
# Get only kanji from levels 1-3
kanji <- wk_subjects(
  types = "kanji",
  levels = c(1, 2, 3)
)

# Get only radicals
radicals <- wk_subjects(types = "radical", levels = 1)

# Get vocabulary
vocabulary <- wk_subjects(types = "vocabulary", levels = 1)
```

### Get Specific Subject

```{r subjects-id}
# Get a specific subject by ID
subject <- wk_subjects_by_id(440)

print(subject$data$characters)
print(subject$data$meanings)
print(subject$data$readings)
```

## Working with Assignments

Assignments represent your progress on specific subjects.

### Get Your Assignments

```{r assignments}
# Get all unlocked assignments
assignments <- wk_assignments(unlocked = TRUE)

# Get assignments for your current level
my_assignments <- wk_assignments(levels = current_level)

# Get assignments that are available for review now
available_now <- wk_assignments(
  available_before = format(Sys.time(), "%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ")
)
```

### Filter by SRS Stage

```{r assignments-srs}
# Get assignments at Apprentice stage (1-4)
apprentice <- wk_assignments(srs_stages = c(1, 2, 3, 4))

# Get assignments at Guru stage (5-6)
guru <- wk_assignments(srs_stages = c(5, 6))

# Get burned items (stage 9)
burned <- wk_assignments(burned = TRUE)
```

### Start an Assignment

```{r assignment-start}
# When you start a lesson, mark the assignment as started
assignment <- wk_assignments_start(123456)
```

## Reviews and Statistics

### Get Review History

```{r reviews}
# Get recent reviews (last 7 days)
seven_days_ago <- format(Sys.time() - 7*24*60*60, "%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ")
recent_reviews <- wk_reviews(updated_after = seven_days_ago)

# Get reviews for specific subjects
subject_reviews <- wk_reviews(subject_ids = c(440, 441, 442))
```

### Create a Review

```{r review-create}
# Record a review (after completing a review session)
review <- wk_reviews_create(
  assignment_id = 123456,
  incorrect_meaning_answers = 0,
  incorrect_reading_answers = 1
)
```

### Get Review Statistics

```{r stats}
# Get statistics for items you struggle with
struggling <- wk_review_statistics(
  percentages_less_than = 75
)

# Get statistics for kanji only
kanji_stats <- wk_review_statistics(
  subject_types = "kanji"
)

# Get statistics for specific subjects
subject_stats <- wk_review_statistics(
  subject_ids = c(440, 441, 442)
)
```

## Study Materials

Study materials let you add custom notes and synonyms to subjects.

### Create Study Material

```{r study-create}
# Add a custom note and synonyms
material <- wk_study_materials_create(
  subject_id = 440,
  meaning_note = "Think of a tall tree reaching to heaven",
  meaning_synonyms = c("tree", "wood", "timber")
)
```

### Update Study Material

```{r study-update}
# Update an existing study material
updated <- wk_study_materials_update(
  id = material$data$id,
  meaning_note = "Updated: Looks like a tree with branches",
  meaning_synonyms = c("tree", "wood", "timber", "forest")
)
```

### Get Study Materials

```{r study-get}
# Get all your study materials
my_materials <- wk_study_materials()

# Get study materials for specific subjects
subject_materials <- wk_study_materials(
  subject_ids = c(440, 441, 442)
)
```

## Pagination

Many endpoints return paginated results. The package provides helpers for this.

### Automatic Pagination

```{r pagination-auto}
# Fetch all pages automatically
all_subjects <- wk_fetch_all_pages(
  wk_subjects,
  types = "kanji",
  verbose = TRUE
)

# This returns a list with:
# - data: all items from all pages
# - page_count: number of pages fetched
# - total_count: total number of items

cat(sprintf("Fetched %d kanji across %d pages\n",
            all_subjects$total_count,
            all_subjects$page_count))
```

### Manual Pagination

```{r pagination-manual}
# Get first page
page1 <- wk_subjects(levels = 1)

# Check if more pages exist
if (wk_has_next_page(page1)) {
  next_url <- wk_next_page_url(page1)
  # You would then parse this URL and make another request
  # Or just use wk_fetch_all_pages()
}

# Extract just the data
subjects_data <- wk_extract_data(page1)
```

## Advanced Usage: R6 Client

For more control, you can use the `WaniKaniClient` R6 class directly.

```{r r6-client}
# Create a client
client <- WaniKaniClient$new(api_token = "your_token")

# Make custom requests
response <- client$get("/subjects", query = list(
  levels = "1,2,3",
  types = "kanji"
))

# Check rate limit status
remaining <- client$rate_limit_remaining
reset_time <- as.POSIXct(client$rate_limit_reset, origin = "1970-01-01")

cat(sprintf("Remaining requests: %d\nResets at: %s\n",
            remaining, reset_time))

# POST request
new_material <- client$post(
  "/study_materials",
  body = list(
    study_material = list(
      subject_id = 440,
      meaning_note = "My custom note"
    )
  )
)

# PUT request
updated <- client$put(
  "/user",
  body = list(
    user = list(
      preferences = list(
        lessons_autoplay_audio = TRUE
      )
    )
  )
)
```

## Rate Limiting

The WaniKani API has a rate limit of 60 requests per minute. The client tracks this automatically:

```{r rate-limit}
client <- WaniKaniClient$new()

# Make some requests
for (i in 1:5) {
  response <- client$get("/user")
  cat(sprintf("Request %d - Remaining: %d\n", i, client$rate_limit_remaining))

  # If you're close to the limit, you can wait
  if (client$rate_limit_remaining < 5) {
    wait_until <- as.POSIXct(client$rate_limit_reset, origin = "1970-01-01")
    wait_seconds <- as.numeric(difftime(wait_until, Sys.time(), units = "secs"))
    message(sprintf("Approaching rate limit. Waiting %d seconds...", wait_seconds))
    Sys.sleep(wait_seconds)
  }
}
```
